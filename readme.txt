<Handwritten Digit Recognizer Model Generator and Visualizer>

To run the visualizer for the program, run the file "visualizer.py". Once opened, you will be presented with three
buttons
    - Exit -> Pressing this button terminates the program
    - Retrain -> Pressing this button intakes the model parameters (set from the top two boxes)
      and retrains a new model based on them. The program will briefly freeze while doing so
    - Predict -> Pressing this button will attempt to predict the value of the digit you draw
      and will clear the canvas (allowing you to draw another digit)
Pressing the escape key will terminate the program
Pressing the 'f' key toggles the fullscreen option for the program. It defaults to fullscreen
